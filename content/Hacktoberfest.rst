What is hacktoberfest?
*****************************
Github and digital ocean are giving anyone who makes four pull requests in october a free tshirt. The owners of these businesses must be doing a great job if they have the excess capital to fund such a crazy initiative! Now's a great time to get involved in open source. I've gotten involved in a few interesting projects done by some talented developers that have taught me alot. 

1. `hackIDE <https://github.com/sahildua2305/hackIDE/>`_ is a site like ideone. It's a compiler / interpreter / text editor. It'sa django project with a responsive front end thanks to bootstrap and features a lot of interesting javascript. I've never worked on someone else's web development project, I always tinker on my own stuff. It has been very interesting to work on `Sahil Dua's <http://sahildua.com/>`_ project,

2. Tensorflow. Everyone knows about tensorflow, right? It's google's neural net framework. To make package maintenance easier they use docker containers. I've been hearing about docker for years but stayed away from it because I was busy doing good work and didn't need another tool, no matter how cutting edge and interesting everyone said it was. Turns out, its fantastic. It's kind of like a virtual environment / virtual machine, but a bit different - any one of the many youtube vids will explain the distinctions. It makes it easier to distribute code because you can ship a machine image along with the code which guarantees that everyone will have the dependencies satisfied and not pull his or her hair out trying to install the right packages without ruining their own environment.

I worked on the tensorflow docker docuementation and then got into docker and started making my own docker images for fun. Also, there is a `dockerhub <dockerhub/>`_ kinda like github where you can upload your docker files and then other people can download them and have the same environment image you had. A link to you docker file on dockerhub can be distributed with your github code that will make it easier to compile. OpenCV could maybe use a set of docker images, that might be helpful.
