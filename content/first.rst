:summary: A brief description and links that cover how this page was made.

I followed a tutorial to make this page! https://fedoramagazine.org/make-github-pages-blog-with-pelican/

Then, I used the Flex Pelican theme documentation to get the nice look of the page.  https://github.com/alexandrevicenzi/Flex Here is a sample config file that I used as a template for Flex. https://github.com/alexandrevicenzi/blog/blob/master/pelicanconf.py

As you can see, I haven't yet looked into how to use RST to make the links on the page more appealing. It's already midnight and I'm tired!
