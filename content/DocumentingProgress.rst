:summary: A little note to self about the importance of documenting progress.

I'm involved in a number of small projects when I'm not at work, or taking care of the kids, or walking the dogs, or fulfilling some boring personal obligation like getting a haircut or going to the grocery store. I worry that I'll forget the details of some of these projects because they get drowned out by the other important things in my life.

So, now I'm interested in 1. FPGAs 2. Game engines (godot and Unreal) 3. ARM assembly programming, 4. Accelerated machine learning on huge datasets 5. etc. etc. etc. It's easy to forget. 
 
Right now I'm working on an OS writing tutorial found here: https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/projects/raspberrypi/tutorials/os/. Maybe there will be some inspiration after doing this project.
